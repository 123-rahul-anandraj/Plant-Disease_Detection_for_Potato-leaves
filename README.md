# Plant-Disease_Detection_for_Potato-leaves

By, literal defition, this plant disease prediction is a web-based application that uses computer vision and neural networks to predict whether that potato plant is suffering from a disease. In order to detect and diagnose the plant infection/disease, leaf infection is diagnosed using image processing.

This project is a more focused and specific version of my previous project [`Plant-Disease_Detection`](https://github.com/123-rahul-anandraj/Plant-Disease-Detection-using-CNN) where it comprehensively covers many more plant leaves other than potato.

The ML model used in this project was been built using Convolutional Neural Network to determine whether the input image of potato leave is afflicted with a disease or not. Some adjustments and improvements has been done in it due to focusing ourself in dealing with potato plants only and twitching up different training/testing values. Resulting, this model was able to achieve the accuracy of about 94.14%.

Tensorflow and keras are also majorly used in the project's development. \
The data processing and image augmentation are done using the Keras deep-learning framework. \
Images of diverse potato plant leaves, both diseased and healthy once, were included in the dataset used in this study. \
 Dataset source: [`potato leaf disease dataset on Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). 

The training & testing portion of this project has been performed using `Google Collab` \
And the frontend(Webpage) has been developed using Python library: `Streamlit`
